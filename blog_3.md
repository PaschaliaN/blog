<h2>PETRA CORTRIGHT</h2>
<p>
I enjoyed Petra Cortright’s work, it represented the current human fixation with technology, the rise of high levels of impatience as a result of the fast-paced internet world.

The first page which used emoji to create a symbol that was resembled the cross to show how humans now worship the digital world. We are attached to our phones and other digital devices to the point that they have become our sacred. 
The arrow keys as we scroll down to get to the bottom of the page tested how impatient we have become as a result of living in a fast-paced world. As I scrolled to the bottom of the page, I was compelled to quit scrolling (a normal reaction to the internet user currently). If I did, I would not have experienced the page that represented the past and the present. The dinosaurs, the sword made me think of the past, the Christmas tree, the engagement rings, the cross, and religion, the emojis interactions and behaviors and human nature spoke about the things that have remained unchanged.

I am really surprised by the title of the project since I find these structures to be far from grotesque. I think they are quite beautiful. However, this might be because of my interest in the gothic architecture. As the project info suggests, finding beauty in these structures might be because I am associating them with the traditional architecture and drawing from what I find beautiful in traditional gothic architecture. Some of the textures, however, made me a little uncomfortable. The architecture on materials that are soft and waxy just didn’t feel right because I am accustomed to seeing the structures on stone-like textures.  I think at this point I would be able to relate to the title of the project.
