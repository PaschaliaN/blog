**DIGITDUEL WEBSITE**

<p>
This is not necessary an interactive art piece but rather a very interactive website. This website was interesting to me because I felt like it embodied both art and UX quite successfully making it quite appealing visually and fun to the user to explore and play with.

The standard to modern design and website design is usually minimalism and often created with photographs and text. This website however features great illustrations, beautiful use of colors and animation and it becomes more elevated with the use of sound, which is pretty uncommon in modern day designs. It gave the website a nice touch.

**The Bowling alley in Santa Fe**
<p>This was once a bowling alley that has now been turned into an art space and is open to the public and the public is allowed to touch anything in the building. We usually visit museum and art spaces but most of them do not allow the observers to engage physically with the pieces.

I love the liberal use of colors especially the neon colors in most of the rooms but my favorite is the  bathroom with which creates an optical illusion. The whole space just seems so surreal and defies the expectations of what a living space should look like.
