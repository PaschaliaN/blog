The hello world assignment was initially challenging since I have no prior experience with programming. The first few weeks I felt quite overwhelmed and unprepared to attack the assignments and I felt like the website p5js was not really preparing me to comprehend what I was putting in my code but blindly copy from the examples.

<p>However, I felt the material we covered in class whenever we had a lecture to be quite comprehensible, looking at my classmates assignments however was what overwhelmed me the most because I felt they were really ahead on programming whilst I just had HTML and CSS knowledge. Working with materials that we had not yet covered in class and I felt quite behind.
The lecture on the coordinate system was a turning point for me since I began to understand the placing of elements on the page. I went ahead and purchased the getting started with p5js text book and this really helped me grasp the material better and learn about new tricks I can do. I am positive now moving forward the more I cover the chapters the more I will be able to create content and better use the time in class to get assistance on areas that I feel I need more help.
Another area that I felt stuck and I would appreciate if I could get more assistance is GitHub and how to push code into GitHub. I didnâ€™t understand how to go about the process.
